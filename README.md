### Introduction
Covid-19 pandemic negatively impacted the aviation sector. Several prestigious companies had to reduce a high percentage of their number of payroll employees because of the worldwide travel restrictions and quarantines; and even worse, some of them had to declare bankruptcy.  
Nowadays, the highly expected vaccine has permitted airlines to return their activities almost to pre-pandemic conditions.
In this context, it is relevant for companies like XYZ Airlines to clearly understand the main variables that determine their customers' satisfaction to be as competitive as possible and gradually recover from the economic crisis.
